I'm a highly-motivated bioinformatician and software engineer with 4 years of experience in medical research and academic publication. I enjoy finding novel solutions to problems, resolving complex technical challenges. I have a broad range of multidisciplinary experience, and am always eager to learn new technologies.

In my current position I am leading the development of software to automatically genotype Huntington Disease data, which has many natural complications which made accurate automation a formidable challenge. We have deployed a release candidate of our software which resolves this problem through a combination of multiple technologies, such as Digital Signal Processing and Support Vector Machines.

I have a reputation for excellence from colleagues with both biological and/or computational backgrounds, and consistently contribute to foundational and architectural design decisions for our own, and other applications developed within the University of Glasgow.
