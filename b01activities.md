I'm a highly-motivated full-stack software developer and  bioinformatician, with 9 years of experience in developing full-stack web applications, command line based analysis tools, medical research and academic publication. I enjoy finding novel solutions to problems, resolving complex technical challenges. I have a broad range of multidisciplinary experience, and am always eager to learn new technologies.

In my current position I am working on an NDA-bound image analysis tool for one of the largest multi-national technology corporations, who have a logo akin to something within a house that lets light in from outside. During my time at Futurice I have employed a large number of modern technologies across the breadth of the stack in order to deliver value to our clients. Some skills I use very frequently include:

- Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, React.JS, Node, Golang
- Pandas, NumPy, R
- Git, Bash,ZSH, Unix shell, LaTeX
- Data visualisation
- x86 Hardware
- AWS and Azure cloud platforms, various serverless technologies
- C++, Lua, Java
- MySQL/PSQL/DynamoDB and various ORMs
